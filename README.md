# Hello there, I'm Santhosh! 👋

## 🐍 Python Enthusiast | 🌐 Web Scraping Ninja | 🛠 API Artisan

With **8 years** of blending data potions and engineering magical scripts, I've now decided to spread my wizardry in the open-source realm. Why did it take me so long? Well, good things come to those who wait! 😜

### 🤓 What I'm currently diving into:
* 🌱 Exploring the vast ocean of open-source standards & practices. Better late than never, right?
* 🤖 Automating the web, one scrape at a time.
* 🚀 Building APIs that are so good, they're almost like spells.

### 💼 Industrial Experience:
* **8 years** of turning tea (ofcourse) ☕️ into code and bytes into business value.

### 🤔 Why Open Source now?
Curiosity didn't just kill the cat, it also led the developer to open-source. I've been told it's a rite of passage, so here I am, learning, contributing, and occasionally breaking things. 🙈
