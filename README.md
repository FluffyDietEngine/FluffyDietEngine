# Hello there, I'm Santhosh aka Fluffy! 👋

## 🐍 Python Enthusiast | 🌐 Web Scraping Ninja | 🛠 API Artisan

With **8 years** of brewing data potions and engineering spellbinding scripts, I've recently caught the open-source bug. What's the catalyst, you ask? A little event known as PyCon India 2023. 🎉

### 🤓 What I'm up to:
* 🌱 Surfing the vast ocean of open-source standards & practices. Some say I'm fashionably late to the party.
* 🤖 Automating the web, one document at a time.
* 🚀 Conjuring APIs that feel like magic.
* 🦀 Diving deep into the realms of Rust. It's...rustic.

### 💼 Past Life Chronicles:
* **8 years** of turning tea (of course!) ☕ into code and bytes into insights.
